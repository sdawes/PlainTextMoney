# SwiftData Performance Optimization Template

Copy this prompt when starting new SwiftData projects to avoid common performance pitfalls.

## üöÄ SwiftData Performance Requirements

I'm building a SwiftData app and need you to follow these performance optimization rules from the start:

### 1. Query Performance Rules
- ALWAYS add `fetchLimit` to queries that don't need all results
- Use `sortBy` in FetchDescriptor, not Swift's `.sorted()`
- Avoid complex predicates - keep them simple
- Use `@Query` in SwiftUI views instead of accessing relationships directly
- Sort data ONCE and cache results when displaying in multiple places

### 2. Threading Rules (CRITICAL)
- SwiftData ModelContext is NOT thread-safe
- NEVER use `Task.detached` with SwiftData operations
- ALWAYS use `@MainActor` for async SwiftData operations
- Use `await Task.yield()` in long-running operations
- Avoid SwiftData operations in computed properties - they can trigger on background threads

### 2.1 Swift 6 + SwiftData Actor Isolation (NEW - 2025)
**Critical for Swift 6 language mode projects:**

#### Project Configuration
- Set `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = nonisolated` in project settings
- Do NOT set SwiftData models as `nonisolated` (breaks SwiftData macros)
- Explicitly mark all SwiftUI views as `@MainActor`

#### Cross-Actor Communication Pattern
```swift
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: MainActor extracts IDs, background actor re-fetches
@MainActor
struct MyView: View {
    private func accountIDsSnapshot() -> [PersistentIdentifier] {
        accounts.map(\.persistentModelID) // Safe on MainActor
    }
    
    private func updateData() async {
        let accountIDs = accountIDsSnapshot()
        await backgroundEngine.process(accountIDs: accountIDs) // Pass IDs only
    }
}

@ModelActor
actor BackgroundEngine {
    func process(accountIDs: [PersistentIdentifier]) async {
        let accounts = fetchAccounts(withIDs: accountIDs) // Re-fetch in actor
        // Process accounts safely...
    }
    
    private func fetchAccounts(withIDs ids: [PersistentIdentifier]) -> [Account] {
        let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Account>(
            predicate: #Predicate { ids.contains($0.persistentModelID) }
        )
        return (try? modelContext.fetch(descriptor)) ?? []
    }
}
```

#### Actor Isolation Rules
- ‚ùå NEVER pass SwiftData models between actors
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS pass `PersistentIdentifier` (Sendable) between actors
- ‚úÖ Each actor re-fetches models using its own ModelContext
- ‚úÖ Use `@ModelActor` for background SwiftData operations
- ‚úÖ MainActor for all UI and @Query operations

### 3. UI Performance Rules
- Cache expensive computations in view initializers, not computed properties
- Limit chart data to reasonable amounts (300-500 points max)
- Pre-aggregate data for display instead of real-time calculations
- Use simple arithmetic for totals/summaries when possible
- Use `.minimumScaleFactor()` for dynamic text that may overflow
- Lock text size with `.environment(\.sizeCategory, .large)` if layout breaks with accessibility sizes

### 4. Data Architecture Pattern
- Raw Data: Store user input with exact timestamps
- Aggregated Data: Pre-calculate for charts/reports
- Display Totals: Use simple math on current values, not database queries
- Relationships: Use cascade delete rules for data integrity
- Timeline Generation: Build portfolio timelines incrementally from account updates

### 5. Performance Caching Strategy
Implement smart caching with invalidation:
- Cache Key: Use hash of relevant data (update count, account count, etc.)
- Cache Storage: Store in service classes with private cache dictionaries
- Invalidation: Clear on data changes or use hash-based validation
- Granularity: Cache at appropriate levels (portfolio-wide vs per-account)

Example pattern:
```swift
private var cache: [String: (data: PerformanceData, hash: Int)] = [:]

func calculateWithCache(accounts: [Account]) -> PerformanceData {
    let currentHash = accounts.hashValue
    if let cached = cache["key"], cached.hash == currentHash {
        return cached.data
    }
    // Calculate and cache with hash
}
```

### 6. Chart Performance Optimization
- Portfolio Timeline: Generate ONCE, filter for display periods
- Date Filtering: Use post-aggregation filtering, not pre-filtering
- Boundary Points: Include last point before filter date for continuity
- Exact Match Detection: Skip boundary points when filter date matches existing data point
- Update Counting: Count visible updates after filtering, not total

### 7. State Management Best Practices
- Use `@State` for view-local state
- Use `@Binding` for bidirectional data flow between views
- Pass state DOWN the view hierarchy, not up
- Synchronize pickers/controls using shared state
- Use `.id()` modifier to force view refreshes when data changes

### 8. Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
‚ùå Complex database queries for simple arithmetic
‚ùå Repeated expensive calculations in SwiftUI computed properties  
‚ùå Unbounded database queries without limits
‚ùå Thread-unsafe SwiftData operations
‚ùå Excessive debug logging in performance-critical paths
‚ùå Generating the same timeline data multiple times
‚ùå Using individual update dates instead of portfolio timeline points
‚ùå Forgetting to handle edge cases (no data, single data point)

### 8.1 Swift 6 Actor Isolation Anti-Patterns
‚ùå Passing SwiftData models between actors (causes data races)
‚ùå Using `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` with SwiftData
‚ùå Making SwiftData models `nonisolated` (breaks macro generation)
‚ùå Accessing MainActor-isolated properties from background actors
‚ùå Sharing ModelContext instances between actors
‚ùå Using `@MainActor.run` to "fix" actor isolation (masks real issues)

### 9. Performance Targets
- ‚ö° Database operations: <50ms
- ‚úÖ UI updates: <100ms  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex calculations: <200ms
- üö® Anything >500ms needs immediate optimization
- üìä Chart rendering: <150ms for 500+ data points

### 10. Real-World Patterns That Work

**Portfolio Performance Calculation:**
- Generate portfolio timeline once
- Filter timeline for display periods
- Cache calculations with hash-based invalidation
- Use graceful fallbacks for insufficient data

**Time Period Filtering:**
- Last Update: Use second-to-last portfolio point
- Month/Year: Use calendar date arithmetic
- All Time: Show complete unfiltered data
- Always maintain chart continuity with boundary points

**Dynamic Period Labels:**
- Detect when requested period has insufficient data
- Fall back to "since [earliest date]" labeling
- Communicate actual period to user clearly

Please implement these patterns from the beginning and remind me if I suggest anything that violates these performance rules.
