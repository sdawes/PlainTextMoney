## 🚀 SwiftData Performance Requirements

I'm building a SwiftData app and need you to follow these performance optimization rules from the start:

### 1. Query Performance Rules
- ALWAYS add `fetchLimit` to queries that don't need all results
- Use `sortBy` in FetchDescriptor, not Swift's `.sorted()`
- Avoid complex predicates - keep them simple
- Use `@Query` in SwiftUI views instead of accessing relationships directly
- Sort data ONCE and cache results when displaying in multiple places

### 2. Threading Rules (CRITICAL)
- SwiftData ModelContext is NOT thread-safe
- NEVER use `Task.detached` with SwiftData operations
- ALWAYS use `@MainActor` for async SwiftData operations
- Use `await Task.yield()` in long-running operations
- Avoid SwiftData operations in computed properties - they can trigger on background threads

### 3. UI Performance Rules
- Cache expensive computations in view initializers, not computed properties
- Limit chart data to reasonable amounts (300-500 points max)
- Pre-aggregate data for display instead of real-time calculations
- Use simple arithmetic for totals/summaries when possible
- Use `.minimumScaleFactor()` for dynamic text that may overflow
- Lock text size with `.environment(\.sizeCategory, .large)` if layout breaks with accessibility sizes

### 4. Data Architecture Pattern
- Raw Data: Store user input with exact timestamps
- Aggregated Data: Pre-calculate for charts/reports
- Display Totals: Use simple math on current values, not database queries
- Relationships: Use cascade delete rules for data integrity
- Timeline Generation: Build portfolio timelines incrementally from account updates

### 5. Performance Caching Strategy
Implement smart caching with invalidation:
- Cache Key: Use hash of relevant data (update count, account count, etc.)
- Cache Storage: Store in service classes with private cache dictionaries
- Invalidation: Clear on data changes or use hash-based validation
- Granularity: Cache at appropriate levels (portfolio-wide vs per-account)

Example pattern:
```swift
private var cache: [String: (data: PerformanceData, hash: Int)] = [:]

func calculateWithCache(accounts: [Account]) -> PerformanceData {
    let currentHash = accounts.hashValue
    if let cached = cache["key"], cached.hash == currentHash {
        return cached.data
    }
    // Calculate and cache with hash
}
```

### 6. Chart Performance Optimization
- Portfolio Timeline: Generate ONCE, filter for display periods
- Date Filtering: Use post-aggregation filtering, not pre-filtering
- Boundary Points: Include last point before filter date for continuity
- Exact Match Detection: Skip boundary points when filter date matches existing data point
- Update Counting: Count visible updates after filtering, not total

### 7. State Management Best Practices
- Use `@State` for view-local state
- Use `@Binding` for bidirectional data flow between views
- Pass state DOWN the view hierarchy, not up
- Synchronize pickers/controls using shared state
- Use `.id()` modifier to force view refreshes when data changes

### 8. Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Complex database queries for simple arithmetic
❌ Repeated expensive calculations in SwiftUI computed properties  
❌ Unbounded database queries without limits
❌ Thread-unsafe SwiftData operations
❌ Excessive debug logging in performance-critical paths
❌ Generating the same timeline data multiple times
❌ Using individual update dates instead of portfolio timeline points
❌ Forgetting to handle edge cases (no data, single data point)

### 9. Performance Targets
- ⚡ Database operations: <50ms
- ✅ UI updates: <100ms  
- ⚠️ Complex calculations: <200ms
- 🚨 Anything >500ms needs immediate optimization
- 📊 Chart rendering: <150ms for 500+ data points

### 10. Real-World Patterns That Work

**Portfolio Performance Calculation:**
- Generate portfolio timeline once
- Filter timeline for display periods
- Cache calculations with hash-based invalidation
- Use graceful fallbacks for insufficient data

**Time Period Filtering:**
- Last Update: Use second-to-last portfolio point
- Month/Year: Use calendar date arithmetic
- All Time: Show complete unfiltered data
- Always maintain chart continuity with boundary points

**Dynamic Period Labels:**
- Detect when requested period has insufficient data
- Fall back to "since [earliest date]" labeling
- Communicate actual period to user clearly

Please implement these patterns from the beginning and remind me if I suggest anything that violates these performance rules.

**Based on successful optimization of PlainTextMoney app that achieved:**
- Portfolio calculations: Complex queries → Simple O(n) arithmetic with caching
- Chart rendering: Repeated calculations → Pre-cached values with hash validation
- Database performance: Unbounded queries → Limited, optimized queries
- Threading stability: Crash-prone → Rock solid @MainActor pattern
- Performance tracking: No metrics → Comprehensive caching with 10-100x speedup
- Chart filtering: Naive re-aggregation → Smart post-aggregation filtering
- Update counting: Total counts → Filtered visible counts matching display
